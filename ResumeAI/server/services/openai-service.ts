Evaluate the resume for ATS compatibility, strengths, and areas for improvement. Then provide a detailed analysis in the following JSON format with these exact fields:

{
  "score": <number between 0-100 representing ATS compatibility>,
  "scoreLabel": <string describing the score: "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", or "Excellent">,
  "strengths": [<array of strings highlighting the resume's strengths>],

  "keywordsFound": [<array of job-relevant keywords found in the resume>],
  "keywordsMissing": [<array of job-relevant keywords that should be considered for inclusion>],
  "summary": <optional brief overall assessment>
}

For the score, use these ranges:
- 0-40: "Poor"
- 41-60: "Fair" 
- 61-80: "Good"
- 81-90: "Very Good"
- 91-100: "Excellent"

For strengths, find 3-5 positive aspects of the resume.
For improvements, suggest 3-5 specific content changes and 3-5 formatting changes.
For keywords, list relevant industry terms found in the resume and suggest 5-10 additional relevant terms.

Only return valid JSON with these exact fields. Do not include explanations outside of the JSON object.
